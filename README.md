# Elastic Moduli Confirmation
 Implementation of "sanity check" from Ramshaw paper. 10.1073/pnas.1421174112

The specific procedure is taken from the supporting supporting information to double check the accuracy of computed elastic moduli. We calculate the É‘ coefficients from equations S1 and S2.

As a sanity check, the alphas should sum up to one. But, it's off by a factor of two on the provided example TMD data.
